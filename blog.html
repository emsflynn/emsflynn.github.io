                        </header>
                        <p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) should outperform humans at most economically valuable work. I’m looking forward to seeing AGI help human society in these ways: Fully automate or significantly reduce human efforts on tasks that are repetitive and non-innovative. In other words, AGI should drastically boost human productivity. Greatly expedite the discovery of new scientific breakthroughs, including but not limited to facilitating human decision making process by providing additional analyses and information. Understand and interact with the physical world effectively, efficiently and safely.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>During my first 2.5 years at OpenAI, I worked on the Robotics team on a moonshot idea: we wanted to teach a single, human-like robot hand to solve Rubik’s cube. It was a tremendously exciting, challenging, and emotional experience. We solved the challenge with deep reinforcement learning (RL), crazy amounts of domain randomization, and no real-world training data. More importantly, we conquered the challenge as a team.</p>

                        <p>From simulation and RL training to vision perception and hardware firmware, we collaborated so closely and cohesively. It was an amazing experiment and during that time, I often thought of Steve Jobs’ reality distortion field: when you believe in something so strongly and keep on pushing it so persistently, somehow you can make the impossible possible.</p>

                        <p> “The data and AI space moves fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you just might miss it.”

2023 was the year of GenAI. And 2024 is shaping up to be…another year of GenAI.

But where 2023 saw teams scrambling to name drop, 2024 will see teams prioritizing real business problems for their AI models. And with renewed focus comes new priorities.

When it comes to the future of data, a rising tide lifts all ships. And GenAI will continue to rise in 2024, raising the standards — and priorities — of the data industry right along with it.

Here are my top 10 predictions for what’s next for data and AI teams — and how your team can stay one step ahead.
<p>1. LLMs will transform the stack<p>
<p>2. Data teams will look like software teams<p>
<p>3. And software teams will become data practitioners<p>
<p>4. RAG will be all the RAGe<p>
<p>5. Teams will operationalize enterprise-ready AI products<p>
</p>

                        <p>It seems that quite a few people with interest in deep learning think of it in terms of unsupervised pre-training,
						autoencoders, stacked RBMs and deep belief networks. It’s easy to get into this groove by watching one of Geoff Hinton
						’s videos from a few years ago, where he bashes backpropagation in favour of unsupervised methods that are able to disc
						over the structure in data by themselves, the same way as human brain does. Those videos, papers and tutorials linger. T
						hey were state of the art once, but things have changed since then.</p>

                        </header

                        <p>These days supervised learning is the king again. This has to do with the fact that you can look at data 
						from many different angles and usually you’d prefer representation that is useful for the discriminative task at hand.
						Unsupervised learning will find some angle, but will it be the one you want? In case of the MNIST digits, sure. Otherw
						ise probably not. Or maybe it will find a lot of angles while you only need one.</p>

                        <p>Companies are collecting more information than ever before. Data analysis is the process of using this information
						to make informed business decisions. Data must be filtered, stored, organized, transformed, and analyzed before useful 
						conclusions can be made.
]
                        When you visit any website or app, your information is probably being collected both directly and indirectly, in a wide 
						range of areas. Personal user data such as the name, address, and contact details of customers are collected directly using
						online forms or account profiles. IP addresses, customer spending habits, and user activity can also be gathered indirectly
						using automated tracking software.

                        It might sound a little invasive, but there’s a reason behind it. The purpose of analyzing customer data is to gain 
						valuable insight and ultimately increase sales. But data analysts aren’t limited to looking at users, they also handle 
						data from competitors, markets, products, and company finances.</p>

						Fortunately for you, business analysts and data analysts are both in demand and bring in high salaries.

                        Business analysts and data analysts have several overlapping responsibilities, so their roles may appear interchangeable. 
						But they have certain key differences. Let’s take a closer look at the similarities and differences between the two areas. <p>
						 <h3 style="text-align: left;">What is Business Analytics?</h3>
                        <p> Business analysis is a process of understanding the scope, objectives, and complexities of business projects. 
						It involves reconciling conflicting expectations between stakeholders and driving the momentum of projects forward, 
						all by employing data analysis techniques. So what do business analysts actually do? These professionals are mainly 
						concerned with analyzing business processes, stakeholder engagement, business agility and assessing the implications 
						of data. They see each of these domains through a business lens, and are constantly searching for the answers to questions 
						such as:<p>
						<ul>
    <li>What type of investments should be made?</li>
    <li>Which actions will be best in a given situation?</li>
    <li>Which project requires more investment over another?</li>
    <li>Which financial instruments should be used?</li>
</ul>

						any sense of it. This data accumulation has increased manifold due to the exponential rise of social media and its usage.
						Making sense of such huge data requires data analytics software and techniques to gain useful insights into customer 
						requirements and preferences when it comes to buying trends.</p>

                        <p>As I reflect on my days as a student, I now realize that there were a few crucial elements that were missing from my data science resume.
						These shortcomings probably resulted in my being rejected for various job positions. Not only was I unable to present myself as a valuable asset 
						to potential teams, but I also struggled to showcase my ability to solve data science problems. However, with time,  I got better and c
						ollaborated with multiple teams to figure out what I was missing and how I could do better if I had to start over.

                         In this blog, I will share the 7 things that students often overlook in their data science resumes, which can prevent hiring managers from calling them 
						 for interviews. </p>

						AI is transforming finance in revolutionary ways, from automating routine tasks to spotting complex patterns. 
						It can pore through millions of data points, documents, and also news articles to generate insights well beyond 
						human capabilities. The potential? Vastly improved forecasting, real-time risk assessment, and all the other wise 
						investment decisions.
                        But it's not just about the profits. Applied ethically, artificial intelligence in finance can also 
						expand access to credit and financial tools. In a world of increasing complexity, AI may hold the key to

						  analyses that we report to our clients. My day-to-day responsibilities involve Python coding, communicating with 
						  clients, and collaborating with my teammates to solve potential issues. We have a small team that is ready to jump in 
						  and work together at points where we need it.<p>
						 <h3 style="text-align: left;">Thriving at a Startup</h3>
			 <p>The office culture at a small startup is unique. Even with independent work, we find a way to work together. 
			 One of my favorite parts about working at a startup is the hands-on nature of our work. It’s motivating to know that
			 I have a direct impact on our company’s success. While I didn’t specifically target startups in my initial job search 
			 after graduation, I am so happy with where I ended up. I interned for bigger companies before coming to Fuqua. It wasn’
			 t until I joined a startup that I realized that I prefer to work in a more tight-knit environment. <p>
